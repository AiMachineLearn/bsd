# bsd
Bias Statement Detector (BSD) computationally detects and quantifying the degree of bias in sentence-level text of news stories. We incorporate common linguistic and structural cues of biased language, including sentiment analysis, subjectivity analysis, modality (expressed certainty), the use of factive verbs, hedge phrases, and many other features. The model achieved greater than 97% accuracy, and accounted for 85.9% of the variance in human judgements of perceived bias in news-like text. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we verified that the model is able to consistently predict the average bias (mean of 91 human participant judgements) with remarkably good fit.
